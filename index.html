    <h1>Bronx residents are testing new ways to reduce drug overdose deaths in the borough
</h1>

    <p> One day as Van Asher conducted a routine checkup of his urine ketones using a test strip, a procedure that is part of the dietary regimen he uses to monitor his epilepsy, he got a life changing idea.
</p>
    <p>Asher, manager of the Syringe Access Program at St Ann's Corner of Harm Reduction on Westchester Avenue in the South Bronx, thought of a new possible way to reduce drug overdose deaths: give users the power to check their heroin for fentanyl before consuming the substanceâ€”with a simple test strip.

    <p>"Since fentanyl is driving the overdose epidemic that we're seeing in this country today, my thought was, what if people could find out fentanyl were in their drugs prior to consuming them," Asher said. "Then they would at least have the option of deciding if they were going to use them differently."
</p>
    <p>Fentanyl was involved in 44 percent of overdose deaths in 2016, up from 16 percent the previous year, according to a report by the New York City Department of Health. Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that can be 50 times as powerful as heroin, is driving the surge in overdose deaths, the agency said.
</p>
    <p>Asher, who has worked at St. Ann's since 1992, is one of many Bronx residents looking for ways to slow the dramatic rise in drug overdose deaths the borough is experiencing. Others are pushing for safe injection sites, increased naloxone kits citywide and peer counseling.
</p>
    <p>South Bronx residents had the city's highest rate of drug overdose deaths in 2016, about 37 per 100,000 New Yorkers, according to the latest report by the Department of Health.

    <p>Acknowledging that the number of overdose deaths in the city is alarming, Mayor Bill de Blasio vowed last year to reduce the statistic by 35 percent over the next 5 years. He implemented a $38 million initiative to increase naloxone distribution and overdose training citywide.
</p>
    <p>Councilman Rafael Salamanca Jr., who represents parts of the South Bronx, introduced a bill in August that would require the city's 1,800 public schools to stock anti-overdose kits. But the mayor's office said equipping schools with overdose kits is not necessary.
</p>
    <p>"I want to be proactive in finding ways to prevent unnecessary tragedies," Salamanca said. "This is one simple way we can start doing so."
</p>
    <p>"We've seen too many overdoses related to opioids this year, and overdose numbers continue to rise alarmingly among teens and young persons in particular, he added. "This is a tragic problem, and any solution we have to help prevent overdoses, particularly through the use of naloxone, should be implemented.

    <p>But Asher thinks naloxone is not enough.
</p>
    <p>When Asher came up with the idea of using test strips to check for fentanyl, he quickly discovered a facility in Canada where they are administered and ordered a shipment to St. Ann's
</p>
    <p>The strips are now available in other harm reduction centers in the city and nationwide, and Asher is working to expand the program.
</p>
    <p>I am a firm believer that an educated consumer is a powerful consumer, regardless of what it is someone is consuming, Asher said.
</p>
    <p>Users are instructed to add sterile water to the prepared heroin cooker, draw up a shot and test the residue using a strip. In about 10-15 seconds, it will indicate whether fentanyl is present or not.
</p>
    <p>"Naloxone should be in everyone's backpack or purse or satchel, on every person, Asher said. "I think a reversed overdose is an amazing thing."
</p>
    <p>"But I think a prevented one would be better," he added.
